# Imperfekt_MQ2

Initial codebase commit includes the following enhancements/fixes:
- Buff Proc fix. Stopping proc buffs from being casted out of combat (ie. Shaman's Leopard line)
- Auto-dismount fix. Stops casters from auto-dismounting in order to interrupt a spell cast.
- AA Titles fix. Enables prefix titles on all PCs.

## Custom Functionality
### Bard Auto Sonata
Auto-Sonata allows the Bard to automatically re-cast Selo's Sonata AA as long as its not on the bard themselves. If set to enabled, we recommend using Shauri's Sonorious Clouding AA for travel as Selo's Sonata will overwrite Travel song and cause the loss of invisibility.

## Credits
Thanks to Vraquil and Kreegoth from the Imperfekt_EQ server for keeping this repository up to date and implementing new functionality.
