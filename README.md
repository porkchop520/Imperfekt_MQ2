# Imperfekt_MQ2

Initial codebase commit includes the following enhancements/fixes:
- Buff Proc fix. Stopping proc buffs from being casted out of combat (ie. Shaman's Leopard line)
- Auto-dismount fix. Stops casters from auto-dismounting in order to interrupt a spell cast.
- AA Titles fix. Enables prefix titles on all PCs.

## Custom Functionality
### Bard Auto Sonata
Auto-Sonata allows the Bard to automatically re-cast Selo's Sonata AA as long as its not on the bard themselves.

### MaxAggro Parameter
This parameter allows the user to specify when to stop using an ability or spell based on their current agro amount.

### Group Buff Breakpoints
This functionality allows the user to specify different buffs to cast on "beggers" depending on the begger's current level. For example, if set up correctly, a Cleric will no longer try to cast Conviction on a level 1 character.

## Credits
Thanks to Vraquil and Kreegoth from the Imperfekt_EQ server for keeping this repository up to date and implementing new functionality.
